Anime Data Analysis using Python. Explored trends, ratings, and genres from MyAnimeList data with Pandas, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook at Visual Studio Code
# 🎌 Anime Data Analysis Project

## 📜 Project Overview
This project explores anime data (from sources like MyAnimeList or Kaggle) to uncover insights into trends, ratings, genres, and popularity. The analysis was conducted using Python for data processing and visualization, with a focus on storytelling with data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Visualization** (Plotly, Seaborn)
- **Scikit-learn** (if you built a recommendation system)

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information about anime titles, including:
- `title`, `genre`, `episodes`, `rating`
- `members`, `popularity`, `score`
- `studio`, `source`, `aired` (date)

**Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020)

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored
1.  What are the highest-rated anime of all time?
2.  How does number of episodes affect rating?
3.  Which genres are most popular?
4.  Is there a relationship between popularity and score?
5.  How have anime trends changed over time?

## 📈 Methods
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, normalized fields, and filtered outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- **Visualization:** Created bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to illustrate trends.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** (If applicable) Processed genre or synopsis text.
- **Machine Learning:** (If applicable) Built a recommendation system using cosine similarity or collaborative filtering.

## 🎯 Results & Insights
- Top 3 highest-rated anime
- Most common genre
- Correlation between popularity and score
- Average number of episodes
